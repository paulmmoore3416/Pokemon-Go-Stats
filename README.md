![Pokémon Stats banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/150.png)

Welcome to Pokemon Stats — a sleek, console-style Pokédex UI that highlights each Pokémon's strengths using a radar chart and friendly qualitative badges. This repository is a demo UI (HTML/CSS/React via CDN) intended for learning, styling, and demos.

## ✨ Highlights

- Console/GitHub gray theme with blue accents and soft glows
- Interactive navigator: search, filter, expand stat popups
- Radar-style stat chart and compact 'Great Stats' badge for standout Pokémon
- Responsive, embeddable single-file UI — works with `python3 -m http.server` or on GitHub Pages

## 📣 Publishing
If you'd like me to create a public GitHub repository named `Pokemon-Stats` and push this code there, I can do that for you — tell me the username or organization you want the repo under (or authorize me). I will ensure the repo is public and does not include any secrets.

## 🧾 Notes
- All assets used are from public sprite sources; no private data or credentials are included.

If you want the README even more graphical (icons for each Pokémon, animated GIFs, or badges), say the word and I’ll add them next.
